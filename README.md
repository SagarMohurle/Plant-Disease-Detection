# Plant Disease Detection

This repository contains code and resources for a plant disease detection project using machine learning and computer vision techniques.
The project aims to accurately identify various plant diseases from leaf images, helping farmers and gardeners take timely action to protect their crops.

# Features

Image Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing leaf images for analysis.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models including CNNs for disease detection.
Data Augmentation: Strategies to enhance the training dataset and improve model performance.
Evaluation: Metrics and methods for evaluating the accuracy and robustness of the models.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model as a web application

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves, sourced from publicly available databases.
